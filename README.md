This is Officioal Repo of the paper Enhancing Brain Tumor Diagnosis using CNN Model: A Comparative Analysis which is available as preprint on TechRxiv, IEEE Preprint's Server. [PAPER LINK] (https://www.techrxiv.org/doi/full/10.36227/techrxiv.170491533.39709620/v1)

#Overview

Brain tumors, characterized by abnormal cell growths within or around the brain, pose significant medical challenges with potentially grave consequences. This research explores the integration of pretrained deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including VGG16, InceptionV3, ResNet50, and NasNetMobile, to automate the diagnosis process using MRI scans. This approach leverages transfer learning and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) to streamline the detection process for the benefit of patients and healthcare providers.

#Methodology

Models Used:

1)VGG16

2)InceptionV3

3)ResNet50

4)NasNetMobile

#Key Techniques:

1)Transfer Learning: Utilizing pretrained models to improve accuracy.

2)Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing parameters such as optimizer choices, activation functions, number of neurons in each dense layer, and learning rates to enhance model performance and also uisng techniques like Bayesian Optimization, Hyperband, RandomSearch
Results
By systematically fine-tuning the hyperparameters, significant enhancements in tumor classification accuracy were demonstrated. This research highlights the importance of customized hyperparameter optimization for pretrained models in advancing the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection.
